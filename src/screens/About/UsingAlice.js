              A green dot can be added by Admins or Editors, as a way to mark
              progress when reviewing a document (note: this is not required,
              just an optional tool)
            </StyledListItem>
            <StyledListItem>
              A red flag can be added by Admins or Editors, as a way to signal
              to team members that a line needs additional review
            </StyledListItem>
            <StyledListItem>
              A star next to a transcription indicates that it is a Gold Standard
              transcription, made by someone who is listed as an Expert in the

              their transcription

        <StyledListItem>
          <b>Consensus score</b>: a reflection of volunteer agreement for a
          single line of text. The consensus score is the average number of
          volunteers who agreed on the aggregate transcription for this line.
          The value here is presented as [x/y] where x = consensus score and
          y = total number of volunteers who transcribed the line.

        To view an individual subject, select it from the list. It will open
        in a new browser page, with the original image on the left side and a
        list of line-by-line transcriptions on the right.
      </BodyText>
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Search' />
      <BodyText>
        Clicking the 'Search' button will open a pop-up module that allows
        you to find a specific subject, as well filter subjects by their status
        or flags. To search for a specific subject, select the ID type (Zooniverse
        ID or Internal ID), enter the name, and click 'Search'. To filter subjects,
        select from the list of options available and click Search. You can
         <b>Sort</b> a list of subjects within a Group by
        clicking on the available column headings. Please note that ALICE only
        supports search within individual groups, not across an entire Workflow
        or Project.
      </BodyText>
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='What am I looking at? Images, markings, and transcriptions' />
      <BodyText>
        Clicking on an individual subject will show you the original image on the
        left side of the screen, and a list of transcriptions on the right.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        The original image will also include different colored lines, which
        represent the aggregated markings made by volunteers in the transcription
        project. Each solid line represents a cluster of individual lines drawn
        by volunteers, which are represented by dotted lines of the same color.
        Circles at the end of each line represent the dots placed by volunteers
        to generate the underline marking. An open circle represents the first
        dot placed by a volunteer; a closed circle represents the second dot.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Clicking on a line of text will open a module that allows you to edit
        the selected transcription. Beneath it, you will see a list of individual
        transcriptions submitted by volunteers. For each individual transcription,
        you will see the Zooniverse username of the volunteer who submitted it
        (if they were logged into a Zooniverse account), and the time and date
        the transcription was submitted.
      </BodyText>
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Pages: viewing, re-ordering, and deleting' />
      <BodyText>
        Navigate across subjects that are multiple pages using the filmstrip viewer
        at the bottom of the Subject View page. Click on a thumbnail to view the full
        page, complete with annotations and transcription data.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Thumbnails labeled with an angle (in degrees) are automatically-generated 
        duplicates of original images. These duplicate images are generated as a 
        way to allow for re-ordering of cross-written or marginal text. The duplicate 
        images of the original page will contain all text written at an angle greater 
        than 25 or 30 degrees from 0 (i.e. text written across the page, from left 
        to right). Subjects using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm will have 25 degrees 
        as the default setting for generating duplicate pages; those using the OPTICS 
        clustering algorithm will have a default setting of 30. 
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Angles are calculated based on the underline drawn below a line of written text. 
        From time to time, volunteers will underline a document from right to left, 
        instead of left to right, resulting in a â€˜false positiveâ€˜ identification of 
        cross-writing (including the auto-generated duplicate page). In these cases, 
        you can use the â€˜Add lineâ€˜ option to copy and paste the text into a new line 
        on the page where it belongs. 
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        To reorder pages, click and drag the image thumbnails as needed.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        To delete pages, select the â€˜Delete Pagesâ€˜ button in the upper right corner of 
        the filmstrip viewer. An â€˜Xâ€˜ will appear in the corner of each thumbnail image. 
        Click on an â€˜Xâ€˜ to delete the page, and a modal will appear asking you to 
        confirm this action. Only auto-generated image duplicates can be truly deleted. 
        If an image does not have a duplicate, clicking the X will instead delete 
        the contents of that page (i.e. transcription data). The text of the confirmation
        modal will notify you which action is taking place (â€˜Delete pageâ€˜ vs. â€˜Delete
        contents of this pageâ€˜).

        The <b>aggregated transcription</b> will be the default selected transcription.
        To change it, select an individual transcription from the list, or write
        your own in the space provided, and click 'Replace with selected'.
        Once a change has been made and the module is closed, the consensus score
        column for that line will read <b>Edited</b>, as it no longer reflects the
        aggregate transcription score. To revert to the aggregated transcription,
        click on the line to reopen the module, select the aggregated transcription
        from the menu, and click 'Replace with selected'.
      </BodyText>
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Re-ordering transcriptions' />
      <BodyText>
        To adjust the reading order of lines, simply click on a line of text and hold, 
        drag it into the desired position, and release the mouse to â€˜dropâ€˜ the line 
        into place.
      </BodyText>  
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Deleting transcriptions' />
      <BodyText>
        To delete a line, open the line you want to delete, select â€˜Delete lineâ€˜, and 
        confirm your cohice. You can use the â€˜Undoâ€˜ button to immediately reverse this 
        action in the current session, but once you end your session, you will not be 
        able to retrieve deleted lines.
      </BodyText> 
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Flags' />
      <BodyText>
        Press the green circle to mark the line as <b>seen</b>, or press the red
        flag if the line <b>needs attention</b>. Fellow Admins, Editors, and
        Viewers will be able to see any flags you add to a subject.
      </BodyText>
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Approving subjects' />
      <BodyText>
        Once a subject has been reviewed and all changes are in place, a subject
        must be marked as Approved in order for the subject to be included in the
        final data export. To mark a subject as Approved, click the â€˜Mark as
        Approvedâ€™ button at the top of the page. You must have Admin-level access
        to ALICE to approve subjects. Editors are able to request Admin approval
        for subjects by clicking â€˜Ready for Reviewâ€™.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        When a subject has been approved, no further actions can be taken unless
        the subject is un-approved by an Admin. To un-approve a subject, click
        the 'Approve' button at the top of the page, and confirm you want to
        un-approve. Please note that when a subject has been un-approved, you
        will not be able to request a data export for that subject until it has
        been re-approved.
      </BodyText>
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Auto-save' />
      <BodyText>
        In lieu of a â€˜Saveâ€˜ button, ALICE includes an auto-save feature that saves
        all changes as you go. The current status of a Save event can be monitored
        at the top of the page.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        When making changes, please check that the Save status says, â€˜ALL CHANGES SAVEDâ€˜ 
        before navigating away from the current page. If the Save status says, â€˜SAVING...â€˜,
        wait until all changes have been saved before leaving the page or closing your
        browser.
      </BodyText>  
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Undo' />
      <BodyText>
        You can use the Undo button to immediately revert an edit, or series of edits.
        The Undo button will only work for changes that you have made in your current
        session. You will not be able to Undo changes made in a previous session, or 
        by another user.
      </BodyText>  
      <AboutTitle level={6} title='Aggregation settings (advanced)' />
      <BodyText>
        The aggregation settings allow you to adjust the way that the raw
        transcriptions are combined together to create aggregated transcriptions.
        To view the aggregation settings for an individual subject, first make
        sure youâ€™re currently viewing that subject in ALICE. Then, choose â€˜Moreâ€™
        in the menu at the top of the page, and select â€˜Edit Aggregation Settingsâ€™
        from the dropdown menu.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Adjusting the aggregation settings may be necessary for a number of
        reasons. For example, if more lines of text are detected than there are
        on the page, this will result in the same transcription appearing twice
        in the viewer. If fewer lines of text are detected than there are on the
        page, multiple lines may be grouped together, resulting in inaccurate
        transcriptions.  Parameter adjustments can be made on a per-subject basis
        in the ALICE interface.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Be sure to adjust a subjectâ€˜s aggregation settings BEFORE you start to make
        any in-line edits. Changing the aggregation settings will cause any custom
        text rearrangements to be lost.
